# ENS, but bad

For Solidity practice, I tried to rebuild the base ENS contracts, looking only at the [EIP-137 spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137), and write tests for them using [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry).

## DO NOT USE THIS

Use the [official ENS contracts](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens) instead. You're welcome.
